        <p><h2>The best bison, beef, and pork burger that you will ever taste</h2></p>
        <p>I first discovered this recipe while stationed in Germany some years ago. My roomate at the time was a very good cook and I only knew how to cook apaghetti. I had told him that I loved burgers but only ever had beef burgers. Shocked, he offered to make a bison burger for me. I was skeptical at first but as soon as the burger hit my taste buds I knew there was no going back to a burger made any other way.</p>
